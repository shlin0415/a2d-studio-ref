# Create Pull Request

Rebase from the latest `origin/main`, squash commits, and create a PR on GitHub with an
intelligent title and description.

## Current Branch Context

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Commits since origin/main:
!`git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo 'N/A (origin/main not available)'`

Uncommitted changes: !`git status --short`

Existing PR: !`gh pr view --json number,title,url 2>/dev/null || echo 'No existing PR'`

## Usage

```
/create-pr $ARGUMENTS
```

**Arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`):**

- `--draft`: Create as draft PR
- `--base <branch>`: Target branch (default: `main`)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# Check if on main/master (should NOT be)
if [[ $(git branch --show-current) == "main" || $(git branch --show-current) == "master" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot create PR from main/master branch"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --short

# Ensure gh CLI is available
gh --version
```

**Action:** If there are uncommitted changes, stop, and then ask user to commit or stash
them first.

### Step 2: Check for Existing PR

```bash
# Check if PR already exists for current branch
gh pr view --json number,title,url 2>/dev/null || echo "No existing PR"
```

**Handle Existing PR:**

- If PR exists, inform user and ask permission to force-update it
- Warn that this will rewrite the commit history and PR description
- If user declines, abort the process

### Step 3: Fetch and Rebase

```bash
# Fetch latest from origin
git fetch origin main

# Check divergence
git log --oneline HEAD ^origin/main

# Non-interactive rebase onto origin/main
git rebase origin/main
```

**Handle Conflicts:** If rebase fails due to conflicts, abort and let user handle rebase
manually:

```bash
# On rebase failure, abort automatically
git rebase --abort

# Inform user to resolve conflicts manually
echo "Rebase failed due to conflicts. Please resolve manually and retry /create-pr"
exit 1
```

### Step 4: Squash Commits into Single Commit

After successful rebase, squash all commits since `origin/main` into a single commit:

```bash
# Count commits to squash
git rev-list --count origin/main..HEAD

# Soft reset to origin/main (keeps changes staged)
git reset --soft origin/main

# Generate commit message using commit-conventions skill
# See .opencode/skills/commit-conventions/SKILL.md for format rules
```

**Generate Commit Message** (following `commit-conventions` skill):

1. Analyze staged changes:

   ```bash
   git diff --cached --name-only
   git diff --cached
   ```

1. Categorize changes (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore/perf)

1. Determine scope from changed files (workflow/engine/reward/dataset/api/docs/etc.)

1. Generate message in format:

   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>

   <body>

   [Optional sections:]
   Key changes:
   - change 1
   - change 2

   Refs: #123, #456
   ```

1. Commit with generated message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <generated commit message>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

### Step 5: Analyze Combined Changes

After squashing into a single commit:

```bash
# Get all changes since origin/main
git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only

# Get full diff content
git diff origin/main...HEAD

# Check commit history
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
```

**Categorize Changes:**

Follow same categorization as the `commit-conventions` skill:

| Type       | When to Use                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability       |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                         |
| `docs`     | Documentation only              |
| `refactor` | Code change without feature/fix |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests          |
| `chore`    | Build, deps, config changes     |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement         |

**Determine Scope:**

Infer from changed files:

- `areal/workflow/` -> `workflow`
- `areal/engine/` -> `engine`
- `areal/reward/` -> `reward`
- `areal/dataset/` -> `dataset`
- `areal/api/` -> `api`
- `areal/utils/` -> `utils`
- `areal/infra/` -> `infra`
- `docs/` -> `docs`
- `examples/` -> `examples`
- Multiple areas -> omit scope or use broader term

### Step 6: Generate PR Title and Description

**PR Title Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <brief description>
```

**Rules:**

- Keep under 70 characters
- Use imperative mood
- No period at end
- Mirror commit message style

**PR Description Format:**

MUST strictly follow the [GitHub PR template](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):

## Error Handling

### Rebase Conflicts

If rebase fails:

1. Show conflict files
1. Provide resolution instructions
1. Wait for user to resolve
1. After resolution, continue with squashing step
1. Offer to abort rebase if needed: `git rebase --abort`

### Squash Failures

If squash/commit fails:

1. Check if there are changes to commit: `git status`
1. Verify no conflicts remain: `git diff --cached`
1. If needed, abort and return to pre-rebase state

### Push Failures

If force push fails:

1. Verify remote branch exists
1. Check GitHub authentication: `gh auth status`
1. Confirm branch protection rules allow force push
1. Provide manual push instructions if needed

### PR Creation/Update Failures

If `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit` fails:

1. Check if PR already exists: `gh pr view`
1. Verify GitHub authentication: `gh auth status`
1. Check for branch protection rules
1. Provide manual PR creation/update link

## Safety Checks

**Before Starting:**

- Confirm no uncommitted changes
- Confirm not on main/master branch
- Check for existing PR and get user permission to overwrite if exists
- Backup branch: `git branch backup/$(git branch --show-current)-$(date +%s)`

**Before Rebase:**

- Fetch latest from origin
- Show divergence summary

**Before Squash:**

- Show commits that will be squashed
- Confirm user wants to proceed

**Before Force Push:**

- **CRITICAL**: Warn user that force push will rewrite history
- Show current commit that will replace remote history
- Confirm branch name
- If PR exists, emphasize that PR history will be rewritten

**Before PR Creation/Update:**

- Show full preview of title/description
- Confirm target branch
- If updating existing PR, show what will change

Location: .opencode/command/create-pr.md
Invocation: /create-pr

## Differences from Claude Code version

1. allowed-tools frontmatter removed
2. File path references updated to .opencode/ paths
3. Added subtask: true to run as subtask (not pollute main context)
4. Added $ARGUMENTS for argument passing
5. Added shell output injection (!`command`) for automatic context
6. Otherwise functionally identical (no model-specific content)

## Design Philosophy

- Automates full PR creation workflow: fetch, rebase, squash, push, create/update PR
- Always squashes all commits since origin/main into a single commit
- Handles existing PRs by detecting them and force-updating after user permission
- Follows repository's Conventional Commits format
- Requires user confirmation at critical steps

## How to Update

### Adding New Scopes
Update "Determine Scope" section with new file path mappings.

### Changing PR Template
Update "PR Description Format" section with new template structure.

### Modifying Workflow Steps
Update relevant "Step N" sections with new git commands or logic.
